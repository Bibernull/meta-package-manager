Use-cases
=========

A collection of user's problems and how ``mpm`` solves them.


Keep system secure
------------------

A [recent study shows that 70% of vulnerabilities lies in outdated libraries](https://info.veracode.com/report-state-of-software-security-open-source-edition.html). One of the key habits of security professionnals to keep a system secure consist in having all software up to date.

``mpm`` helps you upgrade all packages from all managers of a system with one-liner:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ mpm upgrade
    Updating all outdated packages from brew...
    ==> Upgrading 4 outdated packages:
    gnu-getopt 2.35.1 -> 2.35.2
    rclone 1.51.0 -> 1.52.0
    fd 8.1.0 -> 8.1.1
    youtube-dl 2020.05.08 -> 2020.05.29
    (...)
    Updating all outdated packages from cask...
    ==> Upgrading 4 outdated packages:
    balenaetcher 1.5.89 -> 1.5.94, libreoffice 6.4.3 -> 6.4.4
    (...)
    Updating all outdated packages from gem...
    Updating openssl
    (...)
    Updating all outdated packages from npm...
    + npm@6.14.5
    (...)
    Updating all outdated packages from pip...
    Successfully installed dephell-argparse-0.1.3
    Successfully installed dephell-pythons-0.1.15

This is the primary use case of ``mpm`` and the first reason I built it.


Source packages
---------------

You just learned of a fantastic ``broot`` CLI from a friend. Back to your terminal, you can easely search for it and choose your preferred package manager to install it:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ mpm search broot
    ╒════════════════╤═══════╤═══════════╤══════════════════╕
    │ Package name   │ ID    │ Manager   │ Latest version   │
    ╞════════════════╪═══════╪═══════════╪══════════════════╡
    │ broot          │ broot │ brew      │ 0.1.0            │
    ├────────────────┼───────┼───────────┼──────────────────┤
    │ broot          │ broot │ pip       │ 0.1.1            │
    ╘════════════════╧═══════╧═══════════╧══════════════════╛
    2 packages total (brew: 1, pip: 1, cask: 0, gem: 0, mas: 0, npm: 0).

    $ brew install broot
    (...)
    🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/broot/0.13.6: 8 files, 3.5MB

No need to track down the CLI on Github and read the documentation (if it exists in the first place). Or which package manager got the latest version.

.. todo::

    Implement an ``install`` command so all step above can be performed in one go with ``mpm``.


Deduplicate packages
--------------------

Use the `search` command to hunt down packages that were installed via multiple managers.

One exemple I had on my machine, in which ``httpie`` was both installed by the way of ``brew`` and ``pip``:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ mpm installed | grep httpie
    │ httpie  │ httpie  │ brew  │ 2.1.0  │
    │ httpie  │ httpie  │ pip   │ 2.1.0  │

Now you can easely remove one of them, and no longer have to think hard about which is which.

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ python -m pip uninstall httpie
    Found existing installation: httpie 2.1.0
    Uninstalling httpie-2.1.0:
      Would remove:
        /usr/local/bin/http
        /usr/local/bin/https
        /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/httpie-2.1.0.dist-info/*
        /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/httpie/*
    Proceed (y/n)? y
      Successfully uninstalled httpie-2.1.0

.. todo::

    Add arguments to ``installed`` command, or an ``--installed`` boolean flag to ``search`` so we can reduce the searched packages to those installed.


Backup installed packages
-------------------------

You maintain a repository of ``dotfiles``. This helps you spawn up a highly customized working environment in a couple of hours. New job? New machine? Easy: run your dotfiles, get a coffe, come back with everything perfectly in place to start an extremely productive hacking session. But maintaining ``dotfiles`` is a pain.

``mpm`` allows you to dump the whole list of packages installed on your machine:

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ mpm backup ./packages.toml
    Backup package list to ./packages.toml
    Dumping packages from brew...
    Dumping packages from cask...
    Dumping packages from gem...
    Dumping packages from mas...
    Dumping packages from npm...
    Dumping packages from pip...
    1109 packages total (npm: 659, brew: 229, pip: 115, gem: 49, cask: 48, mas: 9).

    $ head ./packages.toml
    # Generated by mpm 3.2.0.
    # Timestamp: 2020-05-29T11:15:29.539863.

    [brew]
    ack = "^3.3.1"
    adns = "^1.5.1"
    aom = "^1.0.0"
    apr = "^1.7.0"
    apr-util = "^1.6.1_3"
    arss = "^0.2.3"
    (...)
